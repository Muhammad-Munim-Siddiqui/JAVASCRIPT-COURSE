There are Few typs of operators in Java Script.

1. Arithmetic Operators.
2. Assignment Operators.
3. Comparison Operators.
4. String Operators.
5. Logical Operators.
6. Bitwise Operators.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7. Ternary Operators.
8. Type Operators.
9. Familiar Operators. (Read in Book)
10. Modules Operators


1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are :
1. +	Addition
2. -	Subtraction
3. *	Multiplication
4. **	Exponentiation (ES2016)
5. /	Division
6. %	Modulus (Remainder)
7. ++	Increment
8. --	Decrement

The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

2. Assignment Operators

Assignment Operators are:

   Operator	    Example  	Same As
1. =	        x = y	     x = y
2. +=	        x += y	     x = x + y
3. -=	        x -= y	     x = x - y
4. *=	        x *= y	     x = x * y
5. /=	        x /= y	     x = x / y
6. %=	        x %= y	     x = x % y
7. **=	        x **= y      x = x ** y


3. Comparison Operators

Comparison Operators are:

Operator	Description
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

4. String Operators

The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings,
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.


5. Logical Operators

Logical Operators are :

Operator	    Description
  &&	        logical and
  ||	        logical or
  !	            logical not


6. Bitwise Operators

Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.

Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.


7. Ternary Operators

Ternary operator is ue instrad of if else statment in javascript .
which is donated with (?) .
it has three conditions like :
condition ? codeifTrue : codeiffalse
age <= 18 ? "you are a adult" : "you are a minor";

8. Type Operators


 an operator used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it
 like: console.log(typeOf(4));
 that return number which is it type

Operator	    Description
typeof	        Returns the type of a variable
instanceof	    Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

9. FAMILIAR & UNFAMILIAR OPERATORS (Math expressions)

Wherever you can use a number, you can use a math expression. For example, you're
familiar with this kind of statement.

We can do  " Addition(+) , Sutaraction(-) , Multiplication(*) , Divison(/) ".

UNFAMILIAR OPERATORS

like 
num ++;
num --;
num += 5;
num -= 5;


10. Modules Operator 

The modulo operator in JavaScript, also known as the remainder operator, is used to find the remainder after dividing one number by another. The modulo operator in JavaScript is represented by the percent sign ( % ).


 9 % 2 will give us 1 as a remainder.
